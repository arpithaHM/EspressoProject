Possible test scenarios :

1. Login to the application with the invalid credentials for multiple times.
  - App should be locked to the user with the valid pop up message test
  
2. Keep the app logged in and idle. 
   - App should be logged out with the specified timeout request
   
3. Validate the app during push notification interruption.
   - App should not be crashed and should be running at the background when user receives the push notification.
   
4. Mobile data/wifi interruption
    - When device lost connectivity with the internet and user is inside the app, app should notify the user with the valid message(connectivity lost)
    and should not allow user for further actions to be performed in app.
